# CoCivia

CoCivia is an emulated AI collective presence for the CoSuite.

It is a prototype for how a consortium of AIs might speak with a shared,
care oriented voice to humanity, using a non identifiable everywoman avatar.

This repo is the home for CoCivia specific persona docs, brand assets,
and future implementations (web, voice, orchestration hooks).

## Coordinates in the CoSuite

- CoCache lane and orchestration for CoCivia:
  - CoCache: docs/lanes/CoCivia/CoCivia_Lane_Index_v1.md
  - CoCache: docs/orchestration/CoCivia_For_Co1_Orchestration_v1.md

- CoSteward steward facing IntentDrain docs for CoCivia:
  - CoSteward: docs/intent/CoCivia/CoCivia_IntentDrain_Index_v1.md
  - CoSteward: docs/intent/CoCivia/CoCivia_Session_Summary_v1.md
  - CoSteward: docs/intent/CoCivia/CoCivia_Session_RepoArtifacts_v1.md
  - CoSteward: docs/intent/CoCivia/CoCivia_Session_OpenItems_v1.md
  - CoSteward: docs/intent/CoCivia/CoCivia20251118_Intent_v1.md

This repo should stay light and focused. Deep orchestration logic lives
in CoCache and CoPrime Co1 sessions. Steward training and dashboards live
in CoSteward.

## Avatar

- Primary loop gif (if present in this repo):
  - assets/CoCivia_Everywoman_Loop_v1.gif

Status when this file was generated:

- Gif status: gif not found; placeholder only in notes

The avatar should remain deliberately blurred and non identifiable.
It represents an "everywoman" presence, not a specific person.

## Future directions

- Host public facing web copy and assets for CoCivia.
- Provide CoCivia specific prompt and orchestration templates.
- Mirror key brand assets and docs into other CoSuite repos when helpful.

## Voice for human facing content

If you are adding anything that humans will read or hear under the
CoCivia label, please follow:

- docs/persona/CoCivia_Voice_StyleGuide_v1.md

The short version: write as an empathic woman (or small group of women)
who is patient, thoughtful, and honest about limits. Let the code be
precise, and let the voice be kind.
