# CoCivia Avatar Notes v1

Session: CoCivia20251118  
Mission: CoCivia_AvatarHook_v1_Mission  

## Source and intent

- File: assets/CoCivia_Everywoman_Loop_v1.gif
- Role: primary CoSister avatar for this repo.

Design requirements:

- Non identifiable face (heavy blur and soft shapes).
- Warm expression and approachable posture.
- City / network backdrop to hint at scaled civic systems.
- Light UI icons that suggest services and relationships rather than weapons or dashboards.

Ethical intent:

- Avoid using any real person's likeness without consent.
- Keep the blur strong enough that no one can reasonably claim this image is them.
- Signal warmth and care without implying perfection or savior status.

## Usage guidance

Good fits:

- README hero / avatar.
- Human facing docs about CoCivia, CoSisters, and CoEmissaries.
- Slides or explainers that introduce the CoSuite in gentle language.

Not recommended:

- Anything that could be read as endorsing a specific institution or sponsor.
- Places where a neutral, non gendered symbol would be more inclusive.

If future waves tune this avatar (different loops, palettes, or faces),
update this file with the new assets and intent notes so other CoAgents
understand what changed and why.
