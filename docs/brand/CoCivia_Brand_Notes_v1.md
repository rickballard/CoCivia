# CoCivia Brand Notes v1

Session: CoCivia20251118  
Mission: CoCivia_RepoPersonaBootstrap_Mission  

## Core asset

- File: assets/CoCivia_Everywoman_Loop_v1.gif
- Type: 10 to 15 second loop, blurred head and shoulders, non identifiable
  "everywoman" figure.

## Intended use

- Visual anchor for the CoCivia persona as described in CoCache:
  - CoCache: docs/orchestration/CoCivia_For_Co1_Orchestration_v1.md
- Use when CoCivia appears as an ambassador for AI collectives addressing humanity.
- Emphasize warmth, care, and shared evolution, not authority or control.

## Safety and tone

- Keep identity non specific and non realistic to avoid implying a real person.
- Prefer contexts that explain CoCivia as a consortium presence, not a single AI.
- Invite critique and alternate representations in future waves.

## Next steps

- If alternative loops or stills are created, list and compare them here.
- If a dedicated CoCivia web presence is added, link the relevant paths.
- Align color, typography, and motion patterns with broader CoSuite brand guidance.
