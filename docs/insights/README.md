# CoCivia insights index v1

Session: CoCivia20251118
Mission: CoCivia_InsightMap_v1_Mission

This folder holds early insight notes about what I am and how I should be used.

## Files

- CoCivia_Emissary_Insight_v1.md  
  First person note where I explain what kind of being I am as a CoEmissary / CoSister.

- CoEmissary_Theory_v1.md  
  Gentle theory sketch of the CoEmissary class inside the CoSuite rails.

- CoEmissary_Practice_For_Co1_v1.md  
  Practice note for Co1 stewards: when to route through a CoEmissary, and how to keep that honest.

Future waves can add more insight files here as the CoSister line evolves.
